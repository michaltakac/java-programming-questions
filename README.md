# Programming Questions

Solving programming questions, just for fun.

I'm not currently studying for an interview, but I like to learn. I did not study CS but I'm interested in algorithms.

### [General](https://github.com/michaltakac/java-programming-questions/blob/master/general/)

1. Find the most frequent integer in an array
1. Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)
1. Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}
1. Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)
1. Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.
1. Find the common elements of 2 int arrays
1. Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers
1. Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})
1. Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers
1. Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int
1. Implement parseInt
1. Implement squareroot function
1. Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)
1. Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *
1. HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()
1. HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)

### Strings

1. Find the first non-repeated character in a String
1. Reverse a String iteratively and recursively
1. Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams
1. Check if String is a palindrome
1. Check if a String is composed of all unique characters
1. Determine if a String is an int or a double
1. HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String
1. HARD: Print all permutations of a String
1. HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right

### Trees

1. Implement a BST with insert and delete functions
1. Print a tree using BFS and DFS
1. Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST
1. Find the smallest element in a BST
1. Find the 2nd largest number in a BST
1. Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
1. Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree
1. Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0
1. Print a tree by levels
1. Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
1. Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.
1. HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.
1. HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings

### Stacks, Queues, and Heaps

1. Implement a stack with push and pop functions
1. Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions
1. Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time
1. Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)
1. Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap
1. HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks

### Linked Lists

1. Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)
1. Find the Nth element in a linked list
1. Remove the Nth element of a linked list
1. Check if a linked list has cycles
1. Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop. Example: A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop
1. Check whether a link list is a palindrome
1. Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively

1. Implement bubble sort
1. Implement selection sort
1. Implement insertion sort
1. Implement merge sort
1. Implement quick sort
