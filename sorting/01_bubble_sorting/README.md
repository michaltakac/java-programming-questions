# Bubble sort :droplet:

In the bubble sort, as elements are sorted they gradually "bubble" (or rise) to their proper 
location in the array, like bubbles rising in a glass of soda. The bubble sort repeatedly 
compares adjacent elements of an array. The first and second elements are compared and swapped 
if out of order.  Then the second and third elements are compared and swapped if out of order.  
This sorting process continues until the last two elements of the array are compared and swapped 
if out of order.
